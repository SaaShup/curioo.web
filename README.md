#### I don't want to read the Hugo documentation (TLDR)

Fine, fine, you are lazy like us. So Hugo in a nutshell:

There are planty of directories:

* `archetypes`: you don't care
* `assets`: put CSS and JS here
* `content`: if your are not [ThÃ©o](https://github.com/demoxzz), you don't care
* `data`: if you don't know what is data in Hugo, you don't care
* `i18n`: translations keystore, one file per language
* `layouts`: the most important thing for you. All start with [`layouts/_default/baseof.html`](layouts/_default/baseof.html)
* `public`: Hugo stuff, forget this directory
* `static`: put images in the `images` directory

Oh, I almost forgot! There is one important rule!

> [!CAUTION]
> DON'T TOUCH THE `hugo.toml` FILE. NEVER. EVER.
